# List Filtering and Transformation with LINQ in C#


This C# program demonstrates how to use LINQ to filter and transform a list of integers. The following operations are performed on the list:

Filter Even Numbers
The program uses the Where() method to select all even numbers from the list (numbers divisible by 2).

Filter Odd Numbers
The program filters out odd numbers (numbers that are not divisible by 2) using another Where() condition.

Filter Negative Numbers
It selects all numbers that are less than zero, thus identifying negative values in the list.

Filter Positive Numbers
The program filters for positive numbers (greater than zero).

Filter Numbers Within a Specific Range
Using Where(), the program filters numbers that fall within a specified range (greater than 15 and less than 22).

Square Each Number
The Select() method is used to transform the list by squaring each number.

Each of these operations is followed by a loop to display the filtered or transformed results. This program is a practical example of how LINQ can be applied to manipulate collections in C#.
